# Problem Statement

## Project Title

Software System Project

## Context

Modern organizations and applications increasingly rely on robust and scalable software solutions to address domain-specific challenges. Manual methods are often inefficient, error-prone, and do not scale, especially as the volume and complexity of data or user interactions grows. Automation and intelligent processing are necessary for accuracy, performance, and better user experience.

## Core Problem

Design and implement a modular software system that:
- Accepts structured input from end users (interactive or file-based)
- Validates and preprocesses the data to ensure correctness
- Processes the data through core algorithms addressing the outlined challenge (e.g., sorting, searching, analysis, or computation)
- Produces outputs or reports in a clear, actionable, and verifiable format
- Handles invalid, missing, or edge-case input with proper error reporting

The system must be reliable, easy to use, and suitable both for demonstration and for deployment in a real or educational environment.

## Objectives

- Analyze requirements and constraints for the target domain or use-case
- Design an appropriate architecture with well-documented workflows and flowcharts
- Implement a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase
- Validate the system using sample and edge-case inputs
- Provide clear documentation including arm diagrams, workflows, pseudocode, and illustrative outputs

## Expected Outcome

By the end of the project, the software will:
- Demonstrate correct results for typical and exceptional scenarios
- Provide artifacts needed for academic evaluation (code, documentation, diagrams, pseudocode, test cases)
- Serve as a robust foundation that can be adapted or extended for advanced applications
